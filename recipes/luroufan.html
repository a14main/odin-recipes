        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Lu Rou Fan <span lang="zh-TW">(滷肉飯)</span>, also known as braised pork rice, is a rice dish that is commonly seen throughout Taiwan and Southern Fujian.
        </p>
        <p>
            The flavor may vary from one region to another, but the basic ingredients remain the same: ground pork marinated and boiled in soy sauce served on top of steamed rice. It is a type of gaifan, or low cost, dish.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb skin-on pork belly (450g, cut into 1/2” pieces)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons oil</li>
            <li>0.9 oz. rock sugar (25g, or about 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar)</li>
            <li>1 small onion or a couple of shallots (diced)</li>
            <li>8 shiitake mushrooms (diced into 1/2” pieces)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup shaoxing wine (60 ml)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons light soy sauce (45 ml)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dark soy sauce (30 ml)</li>
            <li>2 cups water (475 ml)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a medium pot of water to a boil (just enough so that the pork will be fully submerged), and blanch the chopped pork belly for 1 minute. Drain, rinse clean of any scum, and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the oil in a wok over low heat, and add the sugar. Cook the sugar until it starts to melt and then add the onions. Turn up the heat to medium high and stir-fry the onions for a minute. Add the mushrooms and stir-fry for another couple minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the blanched pork, shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce and water. Stir and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, add the spices (which should be tied in cheese cloth), along with the peeled hardboiled eggs and turn the heat to the lowest setting. Simmer for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.
            </li>
            <li>
                At this point the meat should be fall-apart tender. To finish the dish, remove the spice packet and turn up the heat to medium high to thicken the sauce, stirring occasionally. This process should take about 5-minutes. The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon, but there should still be plenty of it left. Serve over steamed white rice.
